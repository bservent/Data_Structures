//WHAT IS THE INTERNET? 

//The internet is a worlwide network of interconnected devices that share data. This is accomplished with each individual devices having an unique IP address or Interent Protocol(12 characters long?) and TCP or Transfer Computer Protocol. These two parameters allow each device to send messages over the internet. The TCP makes sure that when the message is broken up into packets that none are lost and that the data is reliable. 

//ISP = internet service provider = client (servers directly connected to internet)
//URL = Uniform Resource Locator = website address
//HTTP = Hypertext Transfer Protocol = browser from client sends request message to server to send copy of data into view using TCP/IP
//HTTPS = Secure version of HTTP = all info is encrypted

//200 message sent from server then data files are sent in packets to client

//web page loads and browser reassembles the packets
