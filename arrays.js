//Arrays

//set of similar values grouped together (each value = element)
//data structure that is linear and static
//once instantiated, the size of the array cannot change(limiting factor)
//populate them first or populate later

//O NOTATION

//Accessing = 0(1) = index used to complete method in one operation

//Searching = 0(n) = linear search with array not sorted = could take as many operations as the length of array

//Inserting = 0(n) = same reasoning as search

//Deleting = 0(n) = same as search (must tranverse over array to find item to delet)

//Pros for Arrays
//good to store similar contiguous data
//0(1) accessing power is great
//basic & easy to learn

//Cons for Arrays
//size can't be changed once initialized
//insert/delete are not efficient
//can waste storage space
