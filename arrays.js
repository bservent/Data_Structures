//Arrays

//set of similar values grouped together (each value = element)
//data structure that is linear and static
//once instantiated, the size of the array cannot change(limiting factor)
//populate them first or populate later

//O NOTATION

//Accessing = 0(1) = index used to complete method in one operation

//Searching = 0(n) = linear search with array not sorted = could take as many operations as the length of array

//Inserting = 0(n) = same reasoning as search

//Deleting = 0(n) = same as search (must tranverse over array to find item to delet)

//Pros for Arrays
//good to store similar contiguous data
//0(1) accessing power is great
//basic & easy to learn

//Cons for Arrays
//size can't be changed once initialized
//insert/delete are not efficient
//can waste storage space

//ARRAYLIST = array DS as scaffolding but pro is that it is dynamic
//comes from pre-built arraylist class and therefore has functionality includes
//methods: add(@ 1st index), add(specific index), remove(1st object), remove(specific index), get(reference index of array), set(replace elements within arraylist), clear(delete all objects), toArray(convert objects into array)

//O NOTATION 
//access = 0(1) get method
//search = 0(n)
//insert = 0(n)
//delete = 0(n)

//Array vs Arraylist
//array = fixed size but arraylist is dynamic
//arrays can store all data types where arraylist can only store objects
//with arrays methods need to be created but in arraylist methods come with it
//arrays don't take up that much memory where arraylist takes up more because it is a class with built in funcitonality
//arrays good for small tasks
//Arraylist good for interactive tasks where data is always changing
