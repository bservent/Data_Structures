//Data_structures

//a way to store data so that it maybe accessed and manipulated

//Primitive vs Non-Primitive Data Structures
//primitive DS = single values that don't have methods that can be used on them. They are the basis for a computer language. Int, float, pointer, single characters
//non-primitive DS = assembled from primitive DS and therefor are more advanced. The organization of the structure gives a foundation where same type data can easily be accessed and maniputlated. Ex: array, stack, queue, tree, graph, linkedlist

//NPDS can be later sorted into Linear and non-Linear
//Linear = array(static), linkedlist(dynamic), stack(dynamic), queue(dynamic)
//Non-Linear = tree, graph
